Q-Learning Driven Artificial Lemming Algorithm with Elite Pool and Dynamic Vertical Crossover Strategy: A Case Study in Wind Power Forecasting
Artificial Lemming Algorithm (ALA) is an emerging meta-heuristic technique that has shown favorable applicability in various engineering applications. However, the original ALA still suffers from parameter sensitivity, premature convergence to local optima, and slow convergence when handling high-dimensional complex problems. To overcome these inherent limitations, this paper proposes a Q-learning-driven enhanced Artificial Lemming Algorithm (QEALA), which innovatively integrates three core strategies: (1) Q-learning enables adaptive switching between four search behaviors in different optimization tasks, establishing a more robust exploration-exploitation balance. (2) The elite pool strategy provides agents with diverse search directions by leveraging stored historical optimal solutions, thereby thoroughly exploring unknown domains. (3) A dynamic vertical crossover strategy with a counter is proposed to trigger dimension updates when the search stagnates, which helps the algorithm evade local optima. The optimization performance of QEALA is comprehensively evaluated against 14 state-of-the-art algorithms on the IEEE CEC2017 and CEC2022 benchmark suites, as well as 22 constrained real-world engineering problems. Experimental results reveal that QEALA demonstrates significant superiority in both solution accuracy and convergence speed, obtaining optimal solutions on 62.07% of CEC2017 functions (30-dimensional), 58.33\% of CEC2022 functions (20-dimensional), and 77.27% of engineering problems, respectively. Furthermore, QEALA is applied to construct a hybrid deep learning model QEALA-TCN-BiLSTM for wind power forecasting. Compared to mainstream deep learning models, the proposed model achieves lower prediction errors in 8-step-ahead forecasting with MSE=0.0115, R\textsuperscript{2}=0.8714, MAE=0.0687, and RMSE=0.1074. These findings highlight the promising potential of QEALA in tackling more challenging real-world engineering optimization problems.
